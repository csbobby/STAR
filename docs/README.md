Reasoning in the real world is not divorced from situations. A key challenge is to capture the present knowledge from surrounding situations and reason accordingly. STAR is a novel benchmark for Situated Reasoning, which provides challenging question-answering tasks, symbolic situation descriptions and logic-grounded diagnosis via real-world video situations.
